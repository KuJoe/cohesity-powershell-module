## Always On Availability Groups

Use the **AAG name** as the **-sourceServer** when restoring from an AAG backup (e.g. -sourceServer myAAG1)

## Overwrite Warning

Including the **-overwrite** parameter will overwrite an existing database. Use this parameter with extreme caution.

## Multiple Folders for Secondary NDF Files

```powershell
-ndfFolders @{ '.*DataFile1.ndf' = 'E:\SQLData'; '.*DataFile2.ndf' = 'F:\SQLData'; }
```

## Point in Time Recovery

If you want to replay the logs to the very latest available point in time, use the **-latest** parameter.

Or, if you want to replay logs to a specific point in time, use the **-logTime** parameter and specify a date and time in military format like so:

```powershell
-logTime '2019-01-20 23:47:02'
```

Note that when the -logTime parameter is used with databases where no log backups exist, the full/incremental backup that occured at or before the specified log time will be used.
